 Smart Content Creation Agent Simulation using OpenAI and Streamlit
📝 Overview:
This assignment involves building an intelligent content generation tool using Streamlit and OpenAI's GPT-4 model. The application simulates a multi-agent system where two virtual agents — a Content Creator and a Content Critic — work together to generate, review, and refine technical content on a user-defined topic.

🎯 Objective:
To demonstrate how agentic AI can be used for automated content creation and review, with a focus on Generative AI topics. The user provides a topic, and the system:

Drafts content on the topic.

Critiques the draft for clarity, accuracy, and grammar.

Revises the content based on the feedback.

🛠️ How It Works:
User Input: The user enters a topic (e.g., "Agentic AI").

Content Creation Agent: GPT-4 generates a draft paragraph on the topic.

Content Critic Agent: Another GPT-4 interaction critiques the draft and suggests improvements.

Final Revision: The Content Creator uses the feedback to produce a final improved version
